Description: This package provides tools for estimating marginal hazard ratios in clustered failure time data. It implements a novel weighted estimating equation approach based on a semiparametric marginal proportional hazards model, accounting for within-cluster correlations. The package is designed for researchers in biostatistics and epidemiology who require accurate and efficient estimation methods for survival analysis in clustered data settings. Simulation functions, two real-world datasets including kidney infection dataset and diabetes dataset for demonstration purposes.
