Description: Estimation of marginal hazard ratios in clustered failure time data. It implements a novel weighted estimating equation approach based on a semiparametric marginal proportional hazards model (See Niu, Y. Peng, Y.(2015). "A new estimating equation approach for marginal hazard ratio estimation"), accounting for within-cluster correlations. The package is designed for researchers in biostatistics and epidemiology who require accurate and efficient estimation methods for survival analysis in clustered data settings. Simulation functions, two real-world datasets including kidney infection dataset and diabetes dataset for demonstration purposes.
